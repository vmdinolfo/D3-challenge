          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The Analysis looks to understand the relationship between poverty rates and access to healthcare.
          Data was collected for all 50 states in the United States, as well as Washington D.C. to complete the Analysis.</p>

          <p>The scatter plot above shows the relationship found in the analysis. Based on the data collected, a positive relationship 
            between poverty rates and access to healthcare appears, meaning that as poverty rates increase the percentage of the population
            that lacks healthcare also increases by state.</p>

          <p>The reason for this relationship between poverty rates and access to healthcare is unclear based on the data analyzed for this report.
            Future analysis will be required in order to parse a potential root cause. Considerations for future analysis should include employment rates,
            due to healthcare being tied to employment for many americans, cost of healthcare, and access to public options.
